## Media Management in WordPress:

Using WordPress' CMS, media management is done entirely through the Media tab in the administration features. There media can be added, managed, or removed. Media can either be hosted locally by WordPress or externally with another media hosting service. It is most common for image file types to be hosted locally, and other media, such as videos, to be hosted externally. Images hosted locally with WordPress are created in several different resolutions for optimisation.

Media hosted locally by WordPress can be found in the *Library* section on the Media tab.

To add new media to your WordPress Library, you must navigate to the *Add New* section of the Media tab. From here you can either drag and drop files, or browse your machine for them. Once they are uploaded, they will be formatted and can be found in the *uploads* folder of *wp-content* in your site's folder.

## Single Media Instances and Galleries:

To add instances of media to a page of your WordPress site you must add a content block that supports the media type you want to insert. The common block types that do this are Image, Gallery, Audio, and Video. Image, Audo, and Video block types each support a single instance of the corresponding media type. Galleries support a selection of multiple images, which it displays in an array.

## Plugin Management in WordPress:

Plugin management in WordPress is done through the Plugins tab in the administration features. From this tab you can install, delete, activate, deactivate, update, and edit all of your plugins.

New plugins can be added in two different ways. You can press *Add New* in the Plugins tab to view and searcg WordPress' full library of available plugins, andinstall them by pressing *Install Now*, which will add them to your plugins tab. Alternatively, you can download plugins from their developers' sites, and drop them into the *plugins* folder of *wp-content* in your site's folder, after which you will be able to see and manage them in the Plugins tab.
